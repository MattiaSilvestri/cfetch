# cfetch
**Simple fetch tool for Linux written in C++**

![](./resources/showoff.png)


The program is _extremely_ experimental and bugs are to be expected. Feel free to
report any issue and I'll try to fix it if it's within my abilities.  
The program doesn't have a config file (for now).  

The general concept and the structure of the code base was highly inspired by
[sysfex](https://github.com/mehedirm6244/sysfex). 

## Installation
Make sure to have these dependences installed:
- `xorg-xrandr`
- `Material Design Icons Desktop`
- `cmake`
- `make`

Then make the `setup.sh` file executable and run it as root:

``` sh
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```


## TODO
- [ ] Add more colours
- [ ] Add host name
- [ ] Add config file
- [x] Add installation script
